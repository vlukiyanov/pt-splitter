PyTorch implementation of a version of the Splitter algorithm for graph embeddings. Compatible with PyTorch 1.0.0 and Python 3.6 or 3.7 with or without CUDA.

This follows (*or attempts to; note this implementation is unofficial*) the algorithm described in "Is a Single Embedding Enough? Learning Node Representations that Capture Multiple Social Contexts" of Alessandro Epasto, Bryan Perozzi (http://epasto.org/papers/www2019splitter.pdf).

**Currently this is work in progress, and is lacking more tests and further examples. In particular it doesn't yet reproduce any accuracy results.**
