# pt-splitter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vlukiyanov/pt-splitter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vlukiyanov/pt-splitter) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/vlukiyanov/pt-splitter/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/vlukiyanov/pt-splitter)

PyTorch implementation of a version of the Splitter algorithm for graph embeddings. Compatible with PyTorch 1.0.0 and Python 3.6 or 3.7 with or without CUDA.

This follows (*or attempts to; note this implementation is unofficial*) the algorithm described in "Is a Single Embedding Enough? Learning Node Representations that Capture Multiple Social Contexts" of Alessandro Epasto, Bryan Perozzi (http://epasto.org/papers/www2019splitter.pdf).

Currently this is work in progress, and is lacking more tests and further examples.
